# VideoJS Custom Social Share Integration

Custom share button for VideoJS 5. This example was working on version 
5.10.2 to be exact.

## What It Is

When using VideoJS version 5 I could not find anywhere that had a good
full-sized example of how to implement a custom button while also
editing it's functionality. So I pieced together what I found and
built out a working example in hopes that this could help someone
else.

The code will also let you create other custom buttons and their
respective functionality, but you must have an understanding of
basic JS/Jquery.

## What To Do

This is a function that you can implement into your VideoJS project. 
The method accepts variables for the player Object, link that you 
want to share, and a title that will go along with the share.
